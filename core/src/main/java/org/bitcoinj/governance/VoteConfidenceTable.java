/**
 * <p>Tracks GovernanceVotes that are being announced across the network. Typically one is created for you by a
 * {@link PeerGroup} and then given to each Peer to update. The current purpose is to let Peers update the confidence
 * (number of peers broadcasting). It helps address an attack scenario in which a malicious remote peer (or several)
 * feeds you invalid GovernanceVotes, eg, ones that spend coins which don't exist. If you don't see most of the peers
 * announce the GovernanceVote within a reasonable time, it may be that the TX is not valid. Alternatively, an attacker
 * may control your entire internet connection: in this scenario counting broadcasting peers does not help you.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is <b>not</b> at this time directly equivalent to the Bitcoin Core memory pool, which tracks
 * all GovernanceVotes not currently included in the best chain - it's simply a cache.</p>
